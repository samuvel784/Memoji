## Strategic Design Decisions for Emogy

1. **Unrestricted Access + Genuine Progress:** Allowing all 1,000 levels to be played from start avoids player frustration from gating, while keeping stars, best time/moves, coins, and themes tied strictly to real achievements.
2. **Synthesized Procedural Audio:** By generating high-quality PCM WAV cues directly on the device, Emogy eliminates runtime asset downloads, third-party copyright risks, and bloated APK binaries.
3. **Offline-First Privacy:** Operating strictly offline without advertising or analytics SDKs provides a clean, premium user experience that stands out in the casual mobile market.
